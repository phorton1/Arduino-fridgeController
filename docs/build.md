All parts were printed on my Prusa MK3s printer.  The covers
(tops) of the boxes were engraved and cut on my
[cnc20mm](machine) with my new
LaserTree [30 Watt]() laser.

The miniBox was printed out of PETG due to its higher temperature
resistance.  The rest of the parts were printed out of black, or
clear, PLA.  The small parts were printed at 0.2mm layer heights
in "Quality" mode.  The large parts (boxes) were printed at 0.3
layer heights in "Draft" mode.

The tops are engraved into 1/16" Black on White Rotar Engraving Stock
(Duets by Gemini) at 1200mm per minute and 18% power, and cut out at
200mm per minute at 95% power.


After 3D printing the parts, and Laser engraving and cutting the
tops, we proceed to the assembly stages.
